## Travis CI
This repository has a barebones Travis pipeline set up to trigger on pushes to the master branch. The pipeline runs functional/unit go-tests found in the /tests directory. All tests must pass for a successful build. As of now, there is only one unit test to ensure the success of the pipeline, however more will be added in the future. I hope this is not a fruitless endeavor.
